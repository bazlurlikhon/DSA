Question 1 :

What is the time complexity T(n) for the following code snippet?
	a = 1
	b = 1
	while(b <= n)
	{
	a += 1
	b += 1
	cout<<"Hi";
	}

Answer:T(n) = O(n)
Question 2 :

Write the output for the following recursive code snippet for n = 3:
	void fun(int n)
	{
	if(n > 0)
	{
	cout<<n:
	fun(n - 1);
	cout<<n;
	}
	}

Answer:Output   321123
